# ModernArchWeatherApp - Modern Architecture Android App with Kotlin & Jetpack Compose üöÄ
- Welcome to BrutalWeatherApp Android application, developed with Modern Android Architecture in mind, Kotlin, and the power of Jetpack Compose. Clean code structure with clear separation of concerns and unidirectional data flow. UI is inspired by the Neubrutalism Style.

<br/>

**This Project  Is Built To Demonstrate Usage Of Google's Recommended Android Development Tools - (Coroutines, Hilt, Modern Architecture Components, Udf, Room, Retrofit, Material Components, Accompanist Lib, and version catalog.**<br/>

The UI is done with simplicity, in the Neobrutalism style, as the focus and the emphasis are placed on robust and clean project architecture.

## What is included:
* **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Ensuring a consistent and predictable behavior.
* **MVI Pattern:** A robust pattern that simplifies user interactions and data updates.
* **Separated Concerns**: Each layer has its distinct responsibility, promoting clarity and simplicity.
* **Single Source of Truth**: All layers rely on one authoritative data source, eliminating inconsistencies.
* **Domain Layer**: An optional layer that encapsulates all the business logic, making the app robust and efficient, making the app's core functions clear and concise.
* **Loose Coupling and DI**: Used Dependency Injection pattern ensuring that components are independent yet interconnected, enhancing flexibility.

## Design üñº
### Neubrutalism Style

- Neobrutalism, often referred to as "Brutalist Web Design," is a design movement that has its roots in Brutalist architecture. The term "Brutalism" originates from the French word "brut," meaning "raw." In architecture,** Brutalism is characterized by raw, unadorned, and often monolithic concrete structures. **
Similarly, in UI/UX design, Neobrutalism emphasizes rawness, simplicity, and a certain kind of unpolished aesthetic.
- Neubrutalism is more than just a design trend; it's a statement. It challenges the norms of what an app or website should look like and offers a fresh perspective. 
- Neubrutalism is "ugly" on purpose, but some may find it beautiful and bold.
