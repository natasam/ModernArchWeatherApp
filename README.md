# ModernArchWeatherApp ☀
Weather Android App written in Jetpack Compose and Kotlin, the example of Modern architectural design pattern, clean code structure with clear separation of concerns
Modern Android App with Kotlin & Jetpack Compose 🚀
Welcome to BrutalWeatherApp Android application, developed with Modern Android Architecture in mind, Kotlin and the power of Jetpack Compose.
<br/>
### What is there:
Unidirectional Data Flow: Ensuring a consistent and predictable behavior.
MVI Pattern: A robust pattern that simplifies user interactions and data updates.
Separated Concerns: Each layer has its distinct responsibility, promoting clarity and simplicity.
Single Source of Truth: All layers rely on one authoritative data source, eliminating inconsistencies.
Domain Layer: An optional layer that encapsulates all the business logic, making the app robust and efficient, making the app's core functions clear and concise.
Loose Coupling and DI: Used Dependency Injection pattern ensuring that components are independent yet interconnected, enhancing flexibility.

You can add your Weather API key in the Constants.kt [YOUR_API_KEY] file in the data/config folder.
