# ModernArchWeatherApp ☀
Weather Android App written in Jetpack Compose and Kotlin, the example of Modern architectural design pattern, clean code structure with clear separation of concerns
Modern Android App with Kotlin & Jetpack Compose 🚀
Welcome to BrutalWeatherApp Android application, developed with Modern Android Architecture in mind, Kotlin and the power of Jetpack Compose.
<br/>
### What is there:
* **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Ensuring a consistent and predictable behavior.
* **MVI Pattern:** A robust pattern that simplifies user interactions and data updates.
* **Separated Concerns**: Each layer has its distinct responsibility, promoting clarity and simplicity.
* **Single Source of Truth**: All layers rely on one authoritative data source, eliminating inconsistencies.
* **Domain Layer**: An optional layer that encapsulates all the business logic, making the app robust and efficient, making the app's core functions clear and concise.
* **Loose Coupling and DI**: Used Dependency Injection pattern ensuring that components are independent yet interconnected, enhancing flexibility.
